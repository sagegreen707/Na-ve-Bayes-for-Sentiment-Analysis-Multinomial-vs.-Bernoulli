# Na-ve-Bayes-for-Sentiment-Analysis-Multinomial-vs.-Bernoulli
This repository contains an implementation of sentiment analysis using Naïve Bayes classifiers—Multinomial and Bernoulli. The project focuses on classifying text data (e.g., tweets) based on sentiment polarity using these probabilistic models.
