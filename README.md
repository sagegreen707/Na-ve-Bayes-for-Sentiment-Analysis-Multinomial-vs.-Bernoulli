Naïve Bayes for Sentiment Analysis: Multinomial vs. Bernoulli

This repository contains an implementation of sentiment analysis using Naïve Bayes classifiers—Multinomial and Bernoulli. The project focuses on classifying text data (e.g., tweets) based on sentiment polarity using these probabilistic models.

**Features:**
Comparison of Multinomial and Bernoulli Naïve Bayes models
Preprocessing and feature extraction techniques for text classification
Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
**Dataset:**
The implementation is tested on a dataset of tweets, where each tweet is labeled based on sentiment.
